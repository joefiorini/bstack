# bstack

Browser stack tunneling, easy to install and easy to run.

## Install

brew install https://gist.github.com/joefiorini/5868444/raw/bstack.rb

## Setup

Create a file `~/.bstack` and give it your tunnel key as such:

```
BS_KEY=<your private key here>
```

## Run

bstack <port>


Very basic, just supports tunneling for now. I'll add additional features as I need them.
